Introduction
============

In running an online business, we definitely need to list competitors and understand the products, services, and strategies they are implementing on their sites. And usually, we save the results of these explorations in the form of text or spreadsheets using Google Sheets, Microsoft Excel, or other applications.

In simple terms, this process can be referred to as Web Scraping, where we perform the function of retrieving data from a site and turning it into useful information. In general, there are two ways that we can use to carry out this process, namely:

### Automatic Method

In this method, you perform the process of copying / collecting data from a site automatically using coding, applications, or browser extensions.

### Manual method

Where you copy data by copying and pasting from a website manually using your own hands.

Benefits of Web Scraping
========================

The benefits that we can get from applying this process to the business we run, are simply as follows:

### Compare Reviews & Feedback

If you sell a service that is used by many people, they often provide comments or reviews that vary according to what they get. Therefore, having a deep understanding of consumer needs is an obligation. By having this knowledge, you can improve your services or create products that match what the market needs.

To find out, you can read consumer reviews and feedback about your products and services, as well as those of competitors, such as on review blogs, forums, social media, and online marketplaces.

By using the Web Scraping method, the process of reading and collecting these reviews can be simplified and accelerated.

### Get Leads Datasets

What are Leads? Leads mean anyone who has an interest in our products and services and has great potential as a customer or buyer. In this case, Web Scraping can be used to find and copy the data of potential customers who have an interest in the type of product or service you have. For example, if you sell beauty and fashion products, you can find your potential customers through their social media following the topic of beauty and fashion.

### Product or Service Pricing Optimization

For online sellers, knowing the market price and determining the price of a service or product is certainly not easy. There are many things that need to be considered, including production costs, human resources, brand positioning, and prices offered by competitors. In this case, Web Scraping can help you to collect the prices of competitors' business products and services. In the end, you can pay attention to the price trends that occur in the market.

Weaknesses & Obstacles
======================

Although web scraping is a very helpful technique in extracting site data, there are also obstacles to its implementation. At least, the following five things you need to remember if you want to do it:

### The Information Obtained Isn't Always Clear

Whatever method you use, unwanted text, such as HTML tags, will inevitably remain. As a result, you must still clean up the data obtained from web scraping.

### Your Access to a Website Could Be Restricted

Neither the web scraping methods discussed in this article nor the app-based methods are perfect. For example, excessive web scraping on a website may result in the website blocking your IP address.

### Understanding Website Page Structure

Not all web scraping techniques necessitate the use of code. You must, however, understand HTML and CSS. This is required when you use the browser's inspect element feature to locate the location of the data you want to extract.

### Not All Websites Make It Simple to Extract Data

For security reasons, web developers will always update their websites, both in terms of code and page structure. As a result, don't be surprised if you come across a site with difficult-to-extract data.

Techniques & Methods
====================

Web scraping is now made easier with the help of browser extensions and applications. However, the results are still not as good as the manual method or through coding. Next, we will try to discuss six commonly used web scraping techniques.

### Copying Data Manually

The most basic method of web scraping is to manually copy webpage data. This strategy takes a long time since you have to retrieve and save the essential information one by one. However, in terms of data retrieval, this strategy is the most effective. Unlike tools or bots, you already know where you want to copy content from a website. As a result, the results of web scraping in this manner are extremely accurate. If the number of websites or blogs to filter is low, this manual method is advised.

### Using Online Spreadsheet (Google Sheets)

Google Sheets is a web application owned by Google that is used to create spreadsheets. However, this application may also be used to easily perform web scraping. Aside from Google Sheets, all you need is a browser with an inspect element feature. After that, just copy the XPath expression from the website page element whose data you wish to replicate into the Google Sheet's IMPORTXML command.

### XPath Querying

The query language XPath is used to pick nodes from XML and HTML file formats. The implementation is very similar to the DOM analysis. It is used to retrieve data from the page's supporting file structure.

Furthermore, XPath may be used to find data on text elements in XML and HTML files. As a result, when DOM analysis is less successful, you can use this web scraping technique.

### Method of HTML Parsing

HTML parsing is a way of extracting data from a website by sending HTTP requests to the server that stores the website data. You can use this technique to scrape not just static but also dynamic web pages. HTML parsing also allows you to replicate enormous volumes of data in a short period of time.

Unfortunately, website protection can prevent HTML parsing. Not only that but if you use this strategy too frequently, you may be blocked from a site.

### Analyzing DOM (Document Object Model)

The Document Object Model or DOM is a representation of the structure of a website page written in HTML. When parsing HTML, the DOM of the page you want to extract data from will be loaded first. Fortunately, the DOM also carries the data contained in the HTML file.

Therefore, DOM analysis can be used as an alternative to web scraping on dynamic web pages if HTML parsing does not produce results. To help with this process, you can search for the desired information with a regular expression.

### Using Regular Expressions (RegEx)

Regular expressions are lines of code that are used in search algorithms to locate specific data types in a file. The files in question in the context of web scraping are those that support a website.

The key advantage of utilizing regular expressions for web scraping is that the syntax is consistent across different computer languages. As a result, this technique is extremely adaptable. Furthermore, regular expressions can be used to search for data based on their kinds, such as a product name, price, or email address.

Conclusion
==========

Thus we can conclude that the Web Scraping method can be used in all lines of online business, there are many benefits that we can get if we use this method. One of them is getting information about competitors, and current market trends, although with some obstacles and shortcomings that occur in it.
